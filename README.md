# Java-Photoshop
 This is a project as homework for my school in object oriented programming.
 I was supposed to build a small photoshop programm to edit pictures as png  PPM and a new format YUV image. You can rotate the image, double or crop the size of the picture, make it in greyscale and stack them all togethere. For example 20 pictures of the same photo to make it brighter.
